 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.359   TIME= 09:24:27
 The requested number of CPU cores for shared-memory parallel (2)        
 exceeds the number of physical CPU cores that are available (1).  As    
 the use of virtual CPU cores is not recommended, the number of CPU      
 cores used will be 1.
