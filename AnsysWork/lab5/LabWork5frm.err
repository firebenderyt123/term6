 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      75.941   TIME= 20:33:15
 May create undesirable entities due to incomplete drag operation.       

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      78.297   TIME= 20:34:09
 The drag direction (from the keypoint on drag line 102 that is closest  
 to a keypoint KP of the given area 35) is orthogonal to the area        
 normal at that KP.  Area cannot be dragged by the VDRAG command.        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      78.312   TIME= 20:34:10
 May create undesirable entities due to incomplete drag operation.       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      83.242   TIME= 20:36:52
 Keypoint 75 is far away from the plane normal to the beginning of the   
 drag line path 103.  The line produced may be a poor approximation of   
 the drag line path.  For better approximation minimize this distance.   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      83.273   TIME= 20:36:52
 Keypoint 74 is far away from the plane normal to the beginning of the   
 drag line path 103.  The line produced may be a poor approximation of   
 the drag line path.  For better approximation minimize this distance.

 Keypoint 75 is far away from the plane normal to the beginning of the   
 drag line path 104.  The line produced may be a poor approximation of
